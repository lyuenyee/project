This project aims to explore the relationship between features 1 to 10 launched by company X. Regular meetings were held to discuss the data quality, machine learning model metrics, data visualization and data privacy policy review. All minutes were documented in this repository. A report of the complete analysis along with the python scripts and other documents needed for this analysis can also be found in this repository.
